# Shark Tank Pitch Analyser

This repository contains the source code for an AI-driven system designed to evaluate startup pitches. The tool uses multimodal analysis (audio signal processing + NLP) to assess both delivery confidence and business viability, simulating a venture capital review panel.

## Test Data
The repository includes sample audio files for testing the pipeline:
* **`User-pitch`**: A demo pitch created to test the code (Concept: Swiggy).
* **`User-pitch2`**: An actual short pitch delivered to Y-Combinator by a startup in 2015.

## Usage
When running the script, you will be prompted to enter your own OpenAI API Key in a secure input box to enable the transcription and LLM analysis features.
